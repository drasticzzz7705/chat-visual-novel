# Deploy ChatVisualNovel on Vercel with Planetscale

Follow these steps to deploy ChatVisualNovel on Vercel with a serverless MySQL database provided by Planetscale:

1.  Clone [ChatVisualNovel](https://github.com/prompt-engineering/chat-visual-novel) from GitHub.
2.  Create a Vercel account and connect it to your GitHub account.
3.  Create a [Planetscale](https://app.planetscale.com) account.
4.  Set up your Planetscale database:
    1.  Log in to your Planetscale account with `pscale auth login`.
    2.  Create a password with `pscale password create <DATABASE_NAME> <BRANCH_NAME> <PASSWORD_NAME>`.
    3.  Push your database to Planetscale with `npx prisma db push`.
5.  Configure your Vercel environment:
    - Set `DATABASE_URL` to your Planetscale database URL.
    - Generate an encryption key with `node scripts/gen-enc.js` and set it as `ENC_KEY`.

With these steps completed, your ChatVisualNovel will be deployed on Vercel with a Planetscale serverless MySQL database.

## Local Usage

1.  Clone the [ChatVisualNovel repo](https://github.com/prompt-engineering/chat-visual-novel) from GitHub.
2.  Dependencies on Planetscale services still exist temporarily. Please register as mentioned in the previous section and configure `DATABASE_URL` in the `.env` file.
3.  Run `npm install`.
4.  Generate an encryption key using `node scripts/gen-enc.js` and configure it in the `.env` file in the format `ENC_KEY=***`. (Note: You can copy the `.env` file from env.template)
5.  You can now use the application by running `npm run dev`.
